Problem 2
A container is used to store data, while an iterator is used to
read the data stored in a container.

Problem 3
A container is used to store data, while an algorithm is used to
manipulate the data stored in a container.

Problem 4
The essential difference between a set and a multiset is that
in a set the keys must be unique, while a multiset permits duplicate keys.

Problem 5
A STL function object contains a function that can be treated as a
function using the function call operator.

Problem 11
a: intList1 = {7, 8, 19, 90, 15, 13, 15, 16, 18, 90, 30, 11, 88, 26}
b: intList1 = {12, 14, 20, 13, 15, 16, 18, 90, 30, 11, 88, 26}

Problem 12
The Predicate concept describes a callable that returns a value
testable as a bool. Predicate is typically used with algorithms that
take input data (individual objects/containers) and a predicate, which
is then called on input data to decide on further course of action.

Problem 13
A back_inserter uses the push_back operation of the container while
a front_inserter uses the push_front operation of the container to
add elements to the container. Furthermore, a front_inserter cannot be
used for the vector container.
