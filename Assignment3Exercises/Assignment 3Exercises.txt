1)
a. True
b. True
c. False. The base case stops the recursion.
d. False. The general case is eventually reduced to a base case, but does not
obtain the solution directly.
e. False. A recursive function can be several layers deep if it is
Indirectly Recursive. The base case needs to be identified and solutions
to them need to be provided.
f. True
g. True
h. True

2)
a. The base case is the case where the solution is obtained directly.
b. A recursive case is case that is reduced to a smaller version of itself.

3) A recursive definition is something defined in terms of a smaller version of itself.

4) A recursive algorithm is an algorithm that finds the solution to a given problem by reducing it to smaller versions of itself.

5) A recursive function must have a base case to stop the recursion.

6)
a. Direct recursion is where a function calls itself.
b. Indirect recursion is where a function calls another function which
results in the original function being called.
c. Tail recursion is where the last statement is executed is the recursive call.

7) 
a. 
if (num == 0)
	return 0;

b. 
else if (num < 0)
	return (-num);
	
c. 32
d. 24
e. 0

8) 
a. 
if (u == 0)
	cout << u << " ";
b. 
    else 
    {
        int x = static_cast<int>(v);

        if (v < 'A')
            v = static_cast<char>(x + 1);
        else if (v > 'Z')
            v = static_cast<char>(x - 1);

        cout << v << " ";

        funcEx8(u - 2, v);
    }

c. % & ' ( ) * + , - . / 0 1 0
d. 
e. ] \ [ Z Z Z Z Z Z 0

9) 
a. 8 5 2
b. 7
c. 6 3
d. -85 

10) 
a. The output of this statement is a recursion of Negatives
until the program abruptly stops. This shows the if statement is 
the base case.
b. Zero!
c. Negative Negative Zero! 
The output stops at Zero because is is now at the base case.

11) 
a. 12 18
b. 15 34 72 148
c. 22 47 98
d. No output, since x is less than 10, thus the program cannot proceed to 
the following if and else.

12) 
a. 24
b. -2
c. 149
d. 26

13) 
a. 0
b. 4
c. 8
d. 14

14) 
a. 28 28 28 28 10 8 8 2 0 0 0 0 2
b. 23 23 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 0 0 1
c. 8 8 8 8 8 8 5 3 2 1 0 0 1
d. 36 36 20 16 4 0 0 0 0 4

15) 
a. 10
b. 21
c. -23
d. 2
